This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks developed for Computational Chemistry.
Topics include:

- Basic probability and linear algebra (e.g., vectors, SVD)
- Bayesian inference and statistical methods
- Gibbs sampling and Ising model simulations
- Ordinary and partial differential equation solvers
- Least-squares fitting and optimization
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods
- Simple neural networks implemented in JAX

Each module is organized into folders with self-contained code for simulations, visualizations, and analysis.
